# Beans-n-Cream
A cafeteria website that focuses mostly on coffee and barista. The website should make you crave for coffee and feel warm in the body just by looking at it â˜•

## The Idea behind this poject ðŸ’¡
The idea behind this project is every programmer loves to drik coffe, so i thougth, why not make a website about a cafeteria with a lot's of diffrent good coffes.
## What I learned ðŸ§ 
- Heavely focused on the `design` of this webiste
- Creating a lot's of diffrent `transitions` and working with the `transform` property
